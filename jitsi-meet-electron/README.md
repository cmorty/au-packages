## Features

- Works with any Jitsi Meet deployment
- Local settings
- Builtin auto-updates
- Remote control
- Always-On-Top window

## Package information

This will not use the installer, which installs jitsi-meet only for the current used.
Instead Chocolatey's means of installing a zip-package are used.
Thus the package will be installed for all users and requires administrative rights to update.

This is an automatic package that will update itself as soon as a new version is released.
It is therefore suggested to use `choco-upgrade-all-at-startup` or `choco-upgrade-all-at`, to make sure you always have the latest version.
